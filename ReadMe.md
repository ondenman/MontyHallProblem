#The Monty Hall Problem

You are presented with three doors. Behind one of those doors is a car. A goat stands behind each of the remaining doors.

You are asked to chose a door. You win whatever's behind the door of your chosing. Obviously, you want to chose the door with the car behind.

You chose a door. Then the gameshow host choses a door and opens it to reveal a goat. You're then asked if you want to stick with your original choice or switch to the other door.

Which do you chose? (The gameshow host asks the audience. The audience shouts back. We go to a commercial break.) Is it more likely that you'll win the car if you stick with your original choice? Or do the odds shorten if you switch.
